# Portfolio-Bootstrap-


## Description
This challenge was designed to allow the developer build their own professional porfolio using the HTML, Bootstrap and CSS knowledge taught with the aim of developing it to a better version as the program progress.

This helped me understand Bootstrap and how the different properties of CSS are integrated into it. Understanding better the different ways to style a page and make them user-friendly while adherring to the acceptance criteria.

In the course of this challenge i learnt the use of different CSS properties / syntax and the corresponding Bootstrap syntax and Bootstrap Icons. I have also learnt how to locate the different elements on the HTML page while styling using the parent-child method. At first being able to locate each element on the html page was challenging. I have carefully arranged the codes leaving comments where possible to make it understable and easy for it to be modified by anyone.
